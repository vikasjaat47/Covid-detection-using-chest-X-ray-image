# Covid-detection-using-chest-X-ray-image
In this work, we propose an automatic detection method for COVID-19 infection based on chest X-ray images. Dataset is collected from kaggle platform. The Dataset contain :

536 X-ray images of patients diagnosed with coronavirus.
668 X-ray images of healthy patients.
619 X-ray images of patients diagnosed with viral.
Here we apply two model :

1. CNN Model
   - Accuracy : 95%
   
2. Transfer Learning Approch using MobileNet algorithem with pre-trained Imagenet weights(convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet, and adapt them to behave as feature extractors for the X-ray images)
   - Accuracy : 97%
